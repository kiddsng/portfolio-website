## Documentation
The full documentation can be found here (i.e., not out yet).

### Vite
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is an useful tool that helps build a simple, yet effective, development environment for web projects. It supports multiple modern front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte.

Vite is used to create my project and its development environment with a React template.

### React
[React](https://react.dev/learn/) is used as the main library for the development of my web application because it is the first framework that I learnt to use.

More importantly, this is a powerful framework that comes with many useful features for my project such as:
- JSX (allows for easy and flexible coding)
- Routing with react-router-dom
- Hooks (e.g., useState)
- Additional Components/Modules (e.g., react-vertical-timeline-component and framer-motion)
- And more!

### Tailwind CSS
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/) is used as my main styling (e.g., flexboxes, typography, positioning, margin/padding, etc.).

It is such a simple and efficient CSS framework to use for designing my website.

### Framer Motion
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is an animation library that allows for both simple and complex animations in React projects.

It is used to produce some simple animations for my website.

### GitHub Pages
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers one free site to be deployed publicly for each GitHub account.

My portfolio website is hosted online using this service.
